Players choose their markers

There is a grid, 6x6
Each cell in the grid needs to be represented in gameBoard array

Players in turn click the cells on the grid.
The game firs needs to check if the cell is empty.
If it is empty, the players marker is added to it. The gameBoard array is updated to contain players identifier

After that, the game checks if victory conditions are met.
These are: the player has three markers in a row.
Hard code the possible directions to the cell and iterate through the possible victory conditions after this move
If victory conditions are not met, check if the board is full => stalemate.
If neither => change player.

Repeat until victory conditions are met by player or board is full.


Further refinement: check if victory is still possible, if not => end game on stalemate.
