## The Odin Project TicTacToe

A project aiming to solidify understanding of factory functions and the use of module pattern. The assingment can be seen [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe). 

## Things I've learned during this project:

- using factory functions to create new objects
- how to build and manipulate arrays of objects
- using module patterns to contain parts of a program, in this case separating the game logic and gameboard
- use of for in loops to iterate over object properties (to create dom elements linked to gameboard objects)
